# Contributing to MediaSkrape

Thank you for considering contributing to MediaSkrape. Our team is so glad that you are thinking about being a part of this awesome project, and we welcome any contributions.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### What We're Looking For

Improving documentation, bug triaging, or writing tutorials.


# Ground Rules
### Expectations for behavior
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

# Your First Contribution
Start by looking through the issues page

Some tutorials you can take a look at for your first contribution:
* http://makeapullrequest.com/
* http://www.firsttimersonly.com/
* [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

# Getting started
### A quick walkthrough of how to submit a contribution.
For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

* Create your own fork of the code
* Do the changes in your fork
* Submit a pull request

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email jocelynshenbb@gmail.com instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at jocelynshenbb@gmail.com.

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in MediaSkrape, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that MediaSkrape has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.
