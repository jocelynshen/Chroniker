# MediaSkrape

MediaSkrape is an open source library that contains functions for pulling data from various social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, as well as Gmail, Google Photos, and Google Calendars. This data could take the form of events, pictures, videos, or text posts. The library can be used to easily collect and clean data from these platforms and contains a variety of other functions.

It is often very difficult to find large datasets for studying posts on social media platforms, since these platforms are disparate and tied to various private companies. MediaSkrape aims to find cleaner, faster ways of pulling data from these sites in order to help data scientists find better social media datasets. This library could also be used, say, to aggregate data across platforms and better understand a social media usersâ€™ daily activities across platforms.
